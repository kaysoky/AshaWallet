	Asha for Education has a zero overhead policy on donations, i.e., 100% of all donations get spent on educational projects in India. Further, all of our administrative expenses are kept to a bare minimum, thanks to support from our volunteers. In addition to volunteers' contributions, our administrative expenses (including the 3% transaction fees mentioned above) get covered by our investment income and sales of merchandise. <br/><br />
